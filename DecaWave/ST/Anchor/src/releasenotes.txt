ISSUES:  

1) If antenna delay is too large the resulting RTD measurements are negative
   (internally) and discarded as bad.  So, if it seems as if Time of Flight
   is not working, first clear antenna delays to see if that is the issue.
   
2) This code base supports DW1000-MP  -----> ONLY !!!!!

Source Release Version 2.26  ( 14th May 2014 )
=============================================================================

It is updated with the following changes (w.r.t. release 2.24):

a) changed the version string to 2.26

b) change the antenna default values for 16 and 64 MHz PRF.

c) change dwt_initialise function to handle non-loading of micro code and 
updates to dwt_isr to handle double buffering overrun as outlined in the user manual (rev 2.1)


=============================================================================
Source Release Version 2.24  ( 22nd April 2014 )
=============================================================================

It is updated with the following changes (w.r.t. release 2.19):

a) changed the version string to 2.24

b) Now by default the 6.81 Mb rate uses smart TX mode. 
For more information see section 7.2.31.1 Smart Transmit Power Control in the User Manual.

b) Add dwt_readtxtimestamplo32() and dwt_readrxtimestamplo32() functions to the driver API. 

c) Optimise response/idle time scaling to optimise the turn-on delay/timeout times.
This means that the Tag and Anchor need to have same frame payload lengths. 
If the lengths don’t match (e.g. by varying preamble length, or data payload) 
the receiver will miss frame transmitted by other instance as the receiver will 
timeout or start listening too late.

d) fix lateRX count/incrementing

e) Anchor/Tag instance stopping:
i.  Tag instance fix ACK pending issue before Poll message is sent.
Fix to wait for pending ACK frame to complete transmission before next 
transmission is initiated. E.g. Upon reception of Ranging Init message 
the Tag will start sending the ACK, and also process the received frame 
and change state to send the Poll message. Previously it did not wait for 
the ACK to complete before the Poll was initiated, the Poll transmission would then fail.
ii. Fix for delayed TX fail with wait4response set, the RX was not turned on 
after a LATE. The fix is to enable RX after a LATE event.
iii.Workaround for incorrect handling of ACK request bit; 
In previous software when multiple EVKs are active.... when auto-ACK is not enabled 
and an anchor or a tag received a frame addressed for another node with the ACK request bit set, 
then when it receives the next good frame addressed correctly without the ACK request bit, 
ACK request is erroneously seen as present (because of an IC issue) and this causes a software lock up, 
and a reset of EVB is required to resolve the issue.  This new software is aware of this IC problem and 
includes code to handle it and not lock-up.
iv. Fix for message payload support. Fix the USB2SPI driver in the ARM executable so 
that it can handle SPI writes of more than 57 bytes.
v.  Fix for frame filtering not being set in the anchors. 
The previous release did not set the ACK request in the Ranging Initiation message. 
Because of this the anchor will fail to turn address filtering on when the ranging is started. 
Because it was awaiting the ACK before enabling frame filtering.  Using frame filtering is desired 
operation for both tag and anchor modes as it reduces interference between ranging pairs.  
The fix is for the anchor code to also enable frame filtering after a poll reception 
(i.e. if it has not seen the ack and already enabled it).
vi. Fix for ACK timeout. This solves an issue where the software would lock-up upon reception 
of another good frame instead of expected ACK frame. As an example this can happen when more 
than one EVK1000 are used in the same space with same channel configuration because of issue 
outlined in v) above.

f)	Fix dwt_readaccdata() API function - the offset passed was not used correctly.

g)	Build option fix for non-discovery mode anchor selection.

h)	Fix ranging bias table index for wideband channels.

i)	Remove SPI speed change to < 3MHz before a call to dwt_readtempvbat function, 
as the temperature can be read at fast (20MHz) SPI rate.

Source Release Version 2.26  ( 14th May 2014 )
=============================================================================

It is updated with the following changes (w.r.t. release 2.19):

a) changed the version string to 2.20

b) Fix for ACK timeout. This solves an issue where the software would lock-up upon 
reception of another good frame instead of expected ACK frame. As an example this 
can happen when more than one EVK1000 are used in the same space with same channel 
configuration because of issue outlined in d) below.

c) In previous software when multiple EVKs are active.... when auto-ack is not enabled 
and an anchor or a tag received a frame addressed for another node with the ACK request 
bit set, then when it receives the next good frame addressed correctly without the ACK 
request bit, ACK request is erroneously seen as present (because of an IC issue) and 
this causes a software lock up, and a reset of EVB is required to resolve the issue.  
This new software is aware of this IC problem and includes code to handle it and not lock-up.

d) Fix for frame filtering not being set in the anchors. The previous release did not 
set the ACK request in the Ranging Initiation message. Because of this the anchor will 
fail to turn address filtering on when the ranging is started. Because it was awaiting 
the ACK before enabling frame filtering.  Using frame filtering is desired operation for 
both tag and anchor modes as it reduces interference between ranging pairs.  
The fix is for the anchor code to also enable frame filtering after a poll reception 
(i.e. if it has not seen the ack and already enabled it).

e) Added ACK request to Range Init message, this is intended operation. 
The design assumed that the Ranging Init message had the ACK request bit set.

f) Fix to wait for pending ACK frame to complete transmission before next transmission 
is initiated. Upon reception of Ranging Init message the Tag will start sending the ACK, 
and also process the received frame and change state to send the Poll message. 
Previously it did not wait for the ACK to complete before the Poll was initiated.
